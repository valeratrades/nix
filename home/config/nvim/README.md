All shortcuts are configured with **Semimak** keyboard layout in mind.

I use lazy for plugin manager, but the configurations for plugins are implemented in the old style

# Tips
- put `Esc` on capslock (tap). Put control there too (hold), - with [keyd](<https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd>), [kanata](<https://github.com/jtroo/kanata>), etc, it's possible to map one action when the key is **held**, another when it's **tapped**.
- ensure shifts are one-shot (refer to [keyd](<https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd>)'s definition)
