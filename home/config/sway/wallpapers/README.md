Different wallpapers have different purposes. I refuse to have them up for stylistic pleasure only. If the attention is taken - it is better be for a good cause.

# Effects space
The ev+ effects that could be induced by wallpapers are mostly:

- work harder because it seems like someone is watching you
- be more creative because the space seems larger
	// the opposite is unlikely to be applicable (now), because by default my desk is in a small room and right against the wall. And even then - do I need an extra picture of a small space if I already am staring at a black screen 60cm away from my head?
