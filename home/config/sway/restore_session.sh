# normally the following variables solve the problem for all (plus the two scripts). But the `swaymsg` things don't keep the env information. I probably could do add `/bin/env sh` to them, but just adding only the needed varibles also works.

# the XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP makes it try to use `kdialog` app. There is no kdialog app, so it's tricked into executing my script in the $PATH, `~/s/help_scripts/kdialog`. The script then redirects it into the file picker solution in `~/.config/nnn/termfilechooser.sh`
# XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=KDE // try if still works
