## Usage
```sh
can --clap hello_the_world
```
Will create a new initialized clap package with according name.

Git is also initialized with initial-commit-message.
On my system all what's left to then post it on git is to call `gn --private` or `gn --public`, and everything is pushed to remote immediately in a fully functional condition.
